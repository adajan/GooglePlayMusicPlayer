# GooglePlayMusicPlayer

This project, is a desktop music player for google play music. With functionality built on and still
being developed onto it. Currently it supports media key presses. I'm looking into adding more support 
such as minimizing to system tray.

In order to build on top of this, a jar/license will be required. This license is for a supported library in the project.
I cannot jar this file with the project, as only the owner can use it. To get this jar go to
